Sick of losing the map you changed to just because the server crashed? Then you need this!

In the event of a crash, when your server reboots, this addon will recognise that the server did not shut down correctly, and will change the map back to the same map that the server crashed on.


Important information:
- This does NOT work on local servers, dedicated servers only!
- A server restart or manual map change does not get affected by this addon. It only runs if the server did NOT shut down correctly.
- For servers that add and remove maps a lot, it is suggested to change your default map to a map that is not likely to be removed, such as the default maps built into Garry's Mod.
